This code will play Hedwig's Theme on an Arduino by attaching a piezo transducer to pins 8 and 9.  The "write EEPROM" code will load the song to the EEPROM, and "read EEPROM" will then read the song from the EEPROM and play it.

The music playing code is heavily based on following original code by Luke Cyca:

Note frequencies based on http://www.phy.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html
